Learning by Design : Dutch Grammar

Learning Dutch is an essential component of Belgian education. From the age of 10 on, until the end of High School, francophone pupils choose either English or Dutch as a second language. 
Dutch grammar, because it is a Germanic language, but also because it has specific grammar characteristics, is quite complex to learn for the pupils.
This section focusses on a singular feature of Dutch language, that is to say the 'rejection of the verb' at the end of the sentence. 
The targetted audience is a 2nd year of Secundary school class (13 years old) with mostly francophone pupils.
More specifically, we will have a look at the conjunction "OMDAT" (because), as in contrast with "WANT" (since). 



1. Desired outcomes

At the end of this session, learners will be able to:

* Understand the connectors OMDAT and WANT
* Understand the notion of 'rejection of the verb' and apply it 


2. Evidence for assessment

* Students will complete a written assessment where they have to complete sentences using the two connectors
* Students will chose a subject of causality and give 10 examples of their choice (e.g. "I love dogs because ...").

3. Learning Experiences

* 6 students will come at the front of the classroom. They each hold a paper with the different components of the sentence (subject1 - verb1 - BECAUSE - subject2 - object verb2 - verb2)
a) The order is mixed, and the students in the classroom have to show their classmates how to place themselves in the right order.
b) Afterwards, by groups of 5 students, each student chooses a word as an example to complete the sentence. The other students review accuracy.
c) During the third round, the words of different groups are mixed, so as to obtain strange sentences !
